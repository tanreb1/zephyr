Tests and Samples
*****************

* Twister's ``dt_compat_enabled_with_alias()`` test case filter was deprecated
  in favor of a new ``dt_enabled_alias_with_parent_compat()`` filter. The old
  filter is still supported, but it may be removed in a future release.

  To update, replace uses like this:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     filter: dt_compat_enabled_with_alias("gpio-leds", "led0")

  with:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     filter: dt_enabled_alias_with_parent_compat("led0", "gpio-leds")
